# EditorTrees
An implementation of AVL Height Balanced Trees in Java

The specifications of the assignment are as follows:

These methods must run in O(log N) time, where N is the size (number of nodes) in the largest tree involved in the operation.

add(char c)
add(char c, int pos)
delete(int pos)
concatenate(EditTree other)
split(int pos)
delete(int start, int length)
get(int pos)
height( )
size( )

Those methods, as well as 

toString( )
EditTree(String s)
EditTree(EditTree t)
get(pos, length)

Were all implemented through group work and pair programming over the course of three weeks.
